1. in server, there may be race condition during multi-thread programming, the result in bucket may not 
   be correct

2. if we use mutex, it may slow down performance, possble solution may be read/write lock 

3. we should use lock_guard/unique_lock/scoped_lock to make sure when exception happens, lock will
   still be unlocked

4. when allocate new resource, we should always use temp-and-swap in case of exception
